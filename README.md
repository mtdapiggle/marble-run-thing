# marble-run-thing
i wanted to learn CAD, didn't know what i wanted to make so i guess i decided on this
i also didn't read the bit about needing a github repo and STEP file exports + onshape link so uh... that's my bad

**session 1:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719739734958409

i already kinda knew how to sketch and extrude and that kind of stuff, but i had no clue how to make a spiral, i eventually had to search it up

**session 2:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719739734958409 
i did this session during school time in a free period i had, i made a thing where the ball can land on and then roll around, eventually dropping down a chute

**session 3:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719814792149569
i made a hole in the chute and tried to extend/make the chute better, i was able to get the bottom of the chute done but didn't really know how to connect it and loft wasn't entirely working 

**session 4:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719819362606659
after a while of trying to figure out what was wrong and why loft wasn't working, i decided to cut out the curves (circled in red)

loft would now work, but i had another problem which was that the loft couldn't include the curves, which made the curves sort of stick out a lot, i tried to fix it with a fillet but it still looks weird. it looks really disconnected and i really don't like it.

**session 5:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719829442715359
i realised that i could use loft on the curves by selecting the sides (image included to help explain, sides circled in green) and then the bottom of the chute, it still looked a bit weird. then i realised that i didn't need to get rid of the curves, i just needed to select the faces in a different way.

after selecting the sides first: ![image](https://github.com/mtdapiggle/marble-run-thing/assets/174234024/0aed852e-1bf4-44cd-bc07-c16e327b504f)
after realising that i just needed to select one side before the other (i got rid of 1 sketch and 2 lofts): ![image](https://github.com/mtdapiggle/marble-run-thing/assets/174234024/7a29f5c1-f729-4aed-8cd6-44911bee97a2)
i am much, much more pleased with the result, words cannot describe how happy i am after being able to get the result that i wanted. (i didn't expect to spend 3 hours on this bit) although, as a perfectionist i can't live without it being fully tangent with a fillet, so i filleted it. 
i also started on working on a chicane part of the marble run.

**session 6:** https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C06SBHMQU8G/p1719905241795599 
the chicane was much harder than i thought, the spline tool was confusing and i eventually had to search up how to get out of the spline tool (which was double clicking the end point) then i thought that i shouldn't use the spline tool, since i thought that i could only move the curves through the points, but then i found  out that i could dimension the points on the spline. when i used the sweep tool, it didn't work. i got confused on what was wrong

**session 7:** 
i realised that when i used the sweep tool, some of the red shapes collided with each other (image added to help explain, red shapes colliding highlighted in blue) ![image](https://github.com/mtdapiggle/marble-run-thing/assets/174234024/ea3b38c7-cd1e-4310-81cb-28d4583c4750)
so i had to change the sketch and make the dimensions longer, and it worked so that's cool.
next, i started work on a way to make everything modular/you can connect them sort of like lego, not sure how i can do this considering that i had already cadded a bunch of stuff up without making it modular, so it could cause problems.
